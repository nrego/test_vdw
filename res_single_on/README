Simplified version of scheme2 L63A in stateC (i.e. all charges in Ala state, VdW in Leu state; Dummy HB3 has non-zero charge)

Removed all waters and all other residues
Removed all 14 pair-interactions

State changes to All dummy (A) -> VdW in Ala state (B)

   (i.e. only atom changing is coupling HB3)

   DUM_HC -> HC (HB3)
   qa=qb=0.0603

   Only relevant interactions are between HB3 and:
        H (on backbone N)
        O (on carbonyl backbone C)
